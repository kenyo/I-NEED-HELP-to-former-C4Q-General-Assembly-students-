# I NEED HELP: to former C4Q/General Assembly students

reference outreach:

calling all (need 2) former students/classmates!! 

i’m applying for a teaching position and pivoting from a pure software role to work with hardware and programming robotics. if you have some spare time in your schedule and have had a positive experience learning something from me (and still remember (i know it’s been a long time)), i would greatly appreciate if you’d consider being a reference for the interview process and help me land this job! 

if interested, please email me at kennyoh517 [at] gmail.com with the following information, and someone from the school may be in contact with you shortly after that to discuss my teaching experience:

Name
Current Title 
Organization
Email

hope to hear from some of you and hope everyone is doing well!
